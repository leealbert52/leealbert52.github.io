<p>I am a statistician. And I have just recently completed a 12-weeks intensive
Data Science training program to become a data scientist. I survived this very  
challenging journey and learned so much about what data science is and what data
scientists do. <p>

<p>This site is all about what I have learned and what I'll be learning in data
science in the years to come.  On the journey I learned and created a GitHub
page to share my experience. <p>

<p>What is there to share?  Not so much even as a statistician. Data science?
No way. I hesitated and I'm not a outspoken person, either. </p>

<p>Then one day I realized that I do have something that is worthy of sharing -
bringing a statistician's perspective into data science practice. So, here I am.
<p>

<p>I'll use this page to discuss different approaches taken by both
statisticians and data scientists in various situations. While debate of which
is a better programming language, R or Python, there is no debate for me. I love
both and will continue to learn and do projects using both languages. <p>
