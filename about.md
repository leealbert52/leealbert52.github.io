<p>This site is about Albert F. Lee, who in November 2017 was laid off by a
health plan after 15 years of services with the company. While the laid off was
not entirely unexpected, it threw him in a tailspin. This is his journey from a  
statistician to become a data scientist.</p>

<p>He received a Master of Arts in Applied Mathematics from the University of
California Santa Barbara. He was interested in numerical analysis at the
beginning. He learned first programming language in FORTRAN. He then applied
to the Ph.D. program at Mathematics Department at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He received a Master of Science degree in
Mathematics instead.</p>

<p>trying to find a job he studied actuarial examinations. It is in the study of
the second exam of Statistics that he switched to the field of Statistics. He
fell in love with Statistics and he received his doctorate degree in Statistics
in the end. He learned SAS as a second programming language.<p>

<p>He taught mathematics and statistics in a graduate school in Arizona for
five years before he entered healthcare industry with Medicare and Medicaid.  
Over the years he did not fully utilize his statistical training and expertise.
He picked up the third programming language in R, not for necessity but for pure
love.<p>

<p>The laid off of 2017 finally prompted him to seek to fully utilize his Skills
in Statistics and learn the fourth programming language Python.
